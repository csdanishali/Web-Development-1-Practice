<li><h3> Smart Village Health System IoT to Envisage Chronical Disease Using Artificial Neural Network</h3> 
    <p> A Smart Village Health System (SVHS) understands the infrastructure, facilities, and schemes open to its villagers. <br> 
        The Internet of Things (IoT) transforms a village health system into an SVHS using ANN that includes schools, highways, the environment, and globalization.,<br> 
        It has been designed with the intention of providing basic healthcare facilities to the inhabitants. ,<br> 
        It also gives information about chronic diseases by employing Artificial Neural Network (ANN). An SVHS model based on the HCV dataset is proposed in this paper. <br> 
        The system is built with cloud and IoT to enable data by means of the patient's input parameters to be collected, indexed, and visualized in a smart village. <br>
        The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and the Scale Conjugate Gradient (SCG) algorithms are implemented with an ANN-based approach <br>
        named " IoT enabled Smart Village Health System to Predict Chronic Disease empowered with Artificial Neural Network (ToVHS)" in order to develop an efficient and smart CHP model. <br> 
        The evaluation of the proposed method indicates that the SCG algorithm achieves promising results with respect to accuracy and miss rates. <br> 
        The predicted accuracy of the proposed model shows 90.39% performance of CHP on the given factors.</p> </li>
